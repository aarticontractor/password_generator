## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://aarticontractor.github.io/password_generator/)
<br>

This project required refactoring of the starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that the user selects. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that is written. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
